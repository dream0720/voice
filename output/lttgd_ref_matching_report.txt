Feature Analysis Methodology:
  • MFCC (Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients): Voice timbre characteristics
  • Mel-spectrogram: Frequency distribution analysis
  • Spectral features: Voice quality metrics (centroid, rolloff, bandwidth)
  • F0 (Fundamental frequency): Pitch characteristics
  • Temporal features: Rhythm and timing patterns
  • Composite scoring: Weighted combination of all features

Similarity Calculation:
  • Cosine similarity for MFCC and Mel features
  • Normalized difference for spectral features
  • Ratio-based similarity for pitch and tempo
  • Weighted average for composite score
